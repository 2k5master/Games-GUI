GAMES GUI LAUNCHER BY 2K5MASTER

This started as a small personal project back when I was just learning Python, and has continued as a way for me to learn new functions and ways to implement and use Python. The first UI for this project was small and pathetic; the window was 400 by 300 and featured about 5 games and mods, as well as a broken "Get Random Game" feature. The progress that this app has made since then is astounding; and I am going to expand on it even further in the future! Now, on to the rest of the documentation.

SETTING UP AND INSTALLING
For right now, I do not have a built in way in the app to change button names and paths. That will probably change in the near future when I add a first time setup launcher and a way in the app to change directories. But if you can't wait until then, just go in the code and manually change the button names and file directories. I promise it won't be long until the next update when this will come natively.

CUSTOMIZE THEME/SET TIMER
These are two core features of the app. Let's start with setting a timer. You can enter a minutes amount, seconds amount, and custom message. Then, if you want a notifcation to come up and an alarm sound to play, select the "Soft Timer" button. If you want your computer to shut down when the timer is over, select the Hard Timer option. Currently, setting a timer will freeze the app until the timer has expired, so please launch your games first or create another window of the app until the timer expires. I am currently working to eliminate this bug, but I don't know whether that will be in the next update or not.

Customizing the theme is also another core function of the app. There are different built in theme presets to choose from. If you want to create a new theme, enter a hexedecimal color code into the fields where it is neccesary. For the background image, browse your directory for the image you want. Then, right click it and select "Copy Path". Then, paste it into the app. Make sure to get rid of the quotation marks and add a double backslash in between folders. Otherwise, you will get an error.

WHAT'S NEXT?
I already sort of covered this, but in Version 4, these new features will (hopefully) be added:
    - First time setup launcher
    - Customize File Paths/Button Names within the app
    - Personalize/Customize everything in the app
    
Have a great day (: !
